Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form?
     We would use semantic HTML because the whole purpose of a login form is to get information.  That is the prime purpose, so semantic HTML is a good option.  

What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML? 
    -It makes it more user friendly, as users are use to the format, the setup, where to find things, etc. 

What are some disadvantages? 
    -It could make things more boring.  keeps things very informational and doesn't allow for the creativity or flexibility for the 
    developer.
